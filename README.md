# Phishing Detector
## About this Project
The end goal of this project is to create a website/app/browser extension of some sort that automatically scans emails, flagging suspicious emails as such to protect users from the security and privacy risks of 
malicious phishing emails. I've fine-tuned a BERT model which now distinguishes between safe and phishing emails with ~90% accuracy on average on most datasets. I plan to build off this model to create a 
privacy-protecting barrier between email users and the malicious parties attempting to phish them.
